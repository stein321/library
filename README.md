This is a simple DB exercise to lookup books by name, author,or ISBN. To use, clone the project and open up the laravel directory in terminal, and input " php -S localhost:8888 -t public " and press enter. This will start up a local environment. Then open up a modern web browser such as firefox or Chrome, and go to the url  "http://localhost:8888/insert ". This will insert cample date into the sqlite DB. Then go to " http://localhost:8888/ " to do searches. Entering in nothing for title or author will display all the results. If a search returns results, clicking on a book will bring up more details in a modal.
